I have been approached by Aakesh to build a website for his real estate company,  the companies name is Sharmaesthetics. He wants a website that has a home page, house gallery page, contact page and an about page. To create this website to his desires I will need the following:

•	Logo
    o	His company logo
•	Header
    o	Links to other pages
•	Footer
    o	Social media links
•	Home page
    o	This will have a display of Aakesh, it will showcase a few houses and have some reviews
•	House gallery page
    o	This will show all the houses he is selling along with the prices
•	Contact page
    o	This will have his contact information and a question box for his clients or anyone with a query
•	About page
    o	This will tell clients about Aakesh’s journey and what led him upto becoming a real estate agent, when the company started, how many houses he has sold.

He would like a photo to be on every page of the site

The purpose of this website is to promote the houses he is selling to a wider audience than just the people that live within his community.
